  abstract = {The use of multiple regression as a data-analytic tool is examined for the cases of balanced and unbalanced designs. The utility of this method for testing specific contrasts, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal, is discussed and some interpretive cautions are examined. An example is given to illustrate the four design situations which are possible under the different coding and cell size conditions.}

  abstract = {Expressly designed for students of the behavioral and social sciences, "Data Analysis for Research Designs" offers a unique perspective that enables readers to choose an appropriate analytic strategy for both experimental and nonexperimental research designs.  "Data Analysis for Research Designs" gives complete, comparative, and equal treatment to the analytical techniques of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple regression/correlation (MRC). It explains why the two yield identical statistical results when used to analyze the data from experiments and discusses the advantages of each in specific situations. It also describes how MRC may be used in nonexperimental designs to understand, predict, and test causal models of behavior.  Throughout, the emphasis is on single-degree-of-freedom comparisons, reducing experiments to simple, meaningful questions that compare two groups of conditions. An actual research problem, identified early in the text, is expanded as more elaborate designs are introduced, showing how research evolves as it is enhanced to include more factors, more levels, and more sensitive analyses. Sample data sets illustrate the analysis of nonexperimental designs as well. Each chapter includes exercises designed for use with a hand-held calculator or personal computer.  Suitable for use by advanced undergraduate and graduate students with an understanding of algebra and statistics, "Data Analysis for Research Designs" develops an appreciation for the nature of research and for the ways in which statistics provide the information needed for interpreting results. It demonstrates how to choose-for-oneself- the most effective strategy for the research situation at hand. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
