  abstract = {The use of multiple regression as a data-analytic tool is examined for the cases of balanced and unbalanced designs. The utility of this method for testing specific contrasts, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal, is discussed and some interpretive cautions are examined. An example is given to illustrate the four design situations which are possible under the different coding and cell size conditions.}
